# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview
Are you trying to figure out what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and want to know which ones are worth the investment? 

With unsupervised machine learning, we can group cryptocurrencies with a clustering algorithm and check for any patterns or groups to best discover which cryptocurrencies we should invest in.
